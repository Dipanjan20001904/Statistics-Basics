        "\n",
        "- Whiskers (Spread of Data): The lines extending from the box (whiskers) show the range of data that is not considered outliers. Typically, whiskers extend to 1.5 times the IQR.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Outliers: Any data points beyond the whiskers are considered potential outliers and are usually marked as individual dots.\n",

A perfectly symmetrical dataset has zero skewness, meaning that the left and right sides of its distribution are mirror images. However, in reality, data distributions often have some degree of skewness, affecting how the mean, median, and mode relate to each other.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Negative Skewness (Left-Skewed): The tail on the left side is longer or fatter than the right side. The mean is usually less than the median. An example could be test scores, where a few extremely low scores drag the average down.\n",

        "How Skewness Affects Data Interpretation:\n",
        "\n",
